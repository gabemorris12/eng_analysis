# Purpose

---

*add content later*

For now, this is just a place to organize all the code from *Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3*. I will add
documentation and type hints for ease of use and other features if I see it to be useful. I also notice some problems
with the existing code that need to be addressed. At the end of the journey,
expect to have a `pip install eng_analysis` package.
